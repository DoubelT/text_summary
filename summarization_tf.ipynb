The reason for that is, that the training crashes the colab instance due to a lack of resources in the free version. We are just using the pretrained model from the tutorial above. Since it is trained on the billsum dataset the evaluation also uses this dataset. In theory we should be able to any dataset we like but it need to have a *summary of the input text.*\n",

The initial uses of this tool may inform future decisions about whether to amend existing law regarding the assessment processes that currently apply to LTSS programs, including IHSS.\\n(b) (1) In addition to the activities set forth in paragraph (9) of subdivision (a) of Section 14186.35, county agencies shall continue IHSS assessment and authorization processes, including making final determinations of IHSS hours pursuant to Article 7 (commencing with Section 12300) of Chapter 3 and regulations promulgated by the State Department of Social Services.\\n(2) No sooner than January 1, 2015, for the counties and beneficiary categories specified in subdivision (e), counties shall also utilize the universal assessment tool, as described in subdivision (c), if one is available and upon completion of the stakeholder process, system design and testing, and county training described in subdivisions (c) and (e), for the provision of IHSS services. This paragraph shall only apply to beneficiaries who consent to the use of the universal assessment process. The managed care health plans shall be required to cover IHSS services based on the results of the universal assessment process specified in this section.\\n(c) (1) No later than June 1, 2013, the department, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging shall establish a stakeholder workgroup to develop the universal assessment process, including a universal assessment tool, for home- and community-based services, as defined in subdivision (b) of Section 14186.1. The stakeholder workgroup shall include, but not be limited to, consumers of IHSS and other home- and community-based services and their authorized representatives, managed care health plans, counties, IHSS, MSSP, and CBAS providers, area agencies on aging, independent living centers, and legislative staff. The universal assessment process shall be used for all home- and community-based services, including IHSS. In developing the process, the workgroup shall build upon the IHSS uniform assessment process and hourly task guidelines, the MSSP assessment process, and other appropriate home- and community-based assessment tools.\\n(2) (A) In developing the universal assessment process, the departments described in paragraph (1) shall develop a universal assessment tool that will inform the universal assessment process and facilitate the development of plans of care based on the individual needs of the consumer. The workgroup shall consider issues including, but not limited to, the following:\\n(i) The roles and responsibilities of the health plans, counties, and home- and community-based services providers administering the assessment.\\n(ii) The criteria for reassessment.\\n(iii) How the results of new assessments would be used for the oversight and quality monitoring of home- and community-based services providers.\\n(iv) How the appeals process would be affected by the assessment.\\n(v) The ability to automate and exchange data and information between home- and community-based services providers.\\n(vi) How the universal assessment process would incorporate person-centered principles and protections.\\n(vii) How the universal assessment process would meet the legislative intent of this article and the goals of the demonstration project pursuant to Section 14132.275.\\n(viii) The qualifications for, and how to provide guidance to, the individuals conducting the assessments.\\n(B) The workgroup shall also consider how this assessment may be used to assess the need for nursing facility care and divert individuals from nursing facility care to home- and community-based services.\\n(d) No later than December 1, 2016, the department, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging shall report to the Legislature on the stakeholder workgroup’s progress in developing the universal assessment process, and shall identify the counties and beneficiary categories for which the universal assessment process may be implemented pursuant to subdivision (e).\\n(e) (1) No sooner than January 1, 2015, upon completion of the design and development of a new universal assessment tool, managed care health plans, counties, and other home- and community-based services providers may test the use of the tool for a specific and limited number of beneficiaries who receive or are potentially eligible to receive home- and community-based services pursuant to this article in no fewer than two, and no more than four, of the counties where the provisions of this article are implemented, if the following conditions have been met:\\n(A) The department has obtained any federal approvals through necessary federal waivers or amendments, or state plan amendments, whichever occurs later.\\n(B) The system used to calculate the results of the tool has been tested.\\n(C) Any entity responsible for using the tool has been trained in its usage.\\n(2) To the extent the universal assessment tool or universal assessment process results in changes to the authorization process and provision of IHSS services, those changes shall be automated in the Case Management Information and Payroll System.\\n(3) The department shall develop materials to inform consumers of the option to participate in the universal assessment tool testing phase pursuant to this paragraph.\\n(f) The department, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging shall implement a rapid-cycle quality improvement system to monitor the implementation of the universal assessment process, identify significant changes in assessment results, and make modifications to the universal assessment process to more closely meet the legislative intent of this article and the goals of the demonstration project pursuant to Section 14132.275.\\n(g) Until existing law relating to the IHSS assessment process pursuant to Article 7 (commencing with Section 12300) of Chapter 3 is amended, beneficiaries shall have the option to request an additional assessment using the previous assessment process for those home- and community-based services and to receive services according to the results of the additional assessment.\\n(h) (1) No later than 15 months after the implementation of the universal assessment process, the department, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging, in consultation with stakeholders, shall report to the Legislature on the results of the initial use of the universal assessment process, and may identify proposed additional beneficiary categories or counties for expanded use of this process and any necessary changes to provide statutory authority for the continued use of the universal assessment process. These departments shall report annually thereafter to the Legislature on the status and results of the universal assessment process. At a minimum, the report shall include, but not be limited to, all of the following:\\n(A) Findings from consumers assessed using the universal assessment tool regarding their satisfaction with both the universal assessment process and the assessor.\\n(B) Analysis of the consumers’ ability to follow and accurately respond to all assessment items.\\n(C) Data collected from the universal assessment process that is compared to previous assessment tool data and this information shall be reported to distinguish the impact of the universal assessment process through the new data collection process.\\n(2) A report submitted pursuant to this subdivision shall be submitted in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code.\\n(i) This section shall remain operative only until September 1, 2018.',\n",
              " 'summary': 'Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services, including, among other services, home- and community-based services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid Program provisions.\\nExisting law, until July 1, 2017, requires the State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging to establish a stakeholder workgroup, as prescribed, to develop a universal assessment process, including a universal assessment tool, to be used for home- and community-based services. No later than March 1, 2014, existing law requires the State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging to report to the Legislature on the stakeholder workgroup’s progress in developing the universal assessment process and to identify the counties and beneficiary categories for which the universal assessment process may be implemented. No sooner than January 1, 2015, upon completion of the design and development of that universal assessment tool, existing law authorizes managed care health plans, counties, and other home- and community-based services providers to test the use of the tool for certain beneficiaries in no fewer than 2, and no more than 4, specified counties if certain conditions have been met. No later than 9 months after the implementation of the universal assessment process, existing law requires the State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging, to report to the Legislature on the results of the initial use of the universal assessment process.\\nThis bill would extend the operation of these provisions until September 1, 2018. The bill would instead require the State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging to report to the Legislature on the stakeholder workgroup’s progress no later than December 1, 2016. The bill would instead require the State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging to report to the Legislature on the results of the initial use of the universal assessment process no later than 15 months after the implementation of the universal assessment process. The bill would require this report to include, among other things, findings from consumers assessed using the universal assessment tool regarding their satisfaction of the universal assessment process.',\n",

Similarly, existing law requires a person who imports or transports a firearm into this state that was obtained outside of the state to have the firearm delivered to a dealer for delivery to that person.\\nThis bill would provide a return process for firearms obtained under the circumstances described above and in violation of the requirement that a firearms dealer conduct the transfer. The bill would require the owner of the firearm to deliver the firearm to a firearms dealer, who would report taking possession of the firearm to the department, and would require the firearm to be returned to the prior owner after a background check and other requirements that apply to a firearms transaction conducted by a dealer have been met. A violation of these provisions by a dealer would be a misdemeanor. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\\nThe bill would make conforming changes to other provisions of law relating to records of firearms transactions kept by the department and a firearms dealer. The bill would, for firearms complying with those return provisions, make conforming changes to other provisions of law that provide exceptions from various prohibitions, including, among others, exceptions to the prohibition against carrying a concealed firearm, to the prohibition against openly carrying a firearm, and to carrying a firearm that is not a handgun in public.

Existing law makes a violation of these provisions a misdemeanor, except that in the case of a handgun the violation is a misdemeanor or a felony, as specified.\\nThis bill would make a violation of those provisions, in the case of a centerfire semiautomatic rifle, punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony, as specified.\\nBy creating new crimes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\\nExisting law requires reports of ownership be filed within certain grace periods for firearms brought or imported into the state by a personal firearms importer or licensed collector.

A violation of these provisions is punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony.\\nThis bill would similarly prohibit a person, corporation, or dealer from transporting a firearm or bringing a firearm into this state for the purpose of selling, loaning, or transferring the firearm with the intent specified above. By expanding the definition of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.', 'Existing law, the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014, approved by the voters as Proposition 1 at the November 4, 2014, statewide general election, authorizes the issuance of general obligation bonds in the amount of $7,545,000,000 to finance a water quality, supply, and infrastructure improvement program.

The bill would require the collaborative to ensure that the professional development training is provided in each region of the state and is available to all school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools. The bill would require the collaborative to submit an implementation plan to the relevant policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature, the Director of Finance, and the Legislative Analyst’s Office within 30 days of the state board’s adoption of the evaluation rubrics, as specified.

Existing law requires the certificate to be filed with the Secretary of State and requires the Secretary of State to notify the Franchise Tax Board of the dissolution. Existing law provides that, upon the filing of the certificate, a corporation is dissolved and its powers, rights, and privileges cease.\\nThis bill would enact provisions similar to those General Corporation Law provisions and make them applicable to nonprofit public benefit corporations, nonprofit mutual benefit corporations, and nonprofit religious corporations. The bill would additionally provide that liability to creditors, if any, is not discharged, the liability of the directors of the dissolved nonprofit corporation is not discharged, and the dissolution of a nonprofit corporation does not diminish or adversely affect the ability of the Attorney General to enforce specified liabilities.\\n(3)\\xa0Existing law requires every corporation doing business within the limits of this state and not expressly exempted from taxation to annually pay to the state, for the privilege of exercising its corporate franchises within this state, a tax according to or measured by its net income, as specified. Under existing law, every corporation, except as specified, is subject to the minimum franchise tax until the effective date of dissolution or withdrawal or, if later, the date the corporation ceases to do business within the limits of this state. Upon certification by the Secretary of State that a nonprofit public benefit corporation or a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation has failed to file the required Statement of Information, existing law requires the Franchise Tax Board to assess a specified penalty.\\nThis bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to abate, upon written request by a qualified nonprofit corporation, as defined, unpaid qualified taxes, interest, and penalties, as defined, for the taxable years in which the nonprofit corporation certifies, under penalty of perjury, that it was not doing business, as defined. The bill would make this abatement conditioned on the dissolution of the qualified corporation within a specified period of time of filing the request for abatement. The bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to prescribe rules and regulations to carry out these abatement provisions and would exempt these rules and regulations from the Administrative Procedure Act.\\n(4)\\xa0Existing state constitutional law prohibits the Legislature from making any gift, or authorizing the making of any gift, of any public money or thing of value to any individual, municipal, or other corporation.\\nThis bill would make certain legislative findings and declarations that abatement of a nonprofit corporation’s liabilities for specified taxes, penalties, and interest serves a public purpose, as provided.\\n(5)\\xa0By expanding the crime of perjury, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.', 'The Real Estate Law provides for the licensure and regulation of real estate brokers and real estate salespersons by the Bureau of Real Estate headed by the Real Estate Commissioner. Existing law requires the commissioner to provide on the Internet specific information regarding the status of every license issued by the department. That law requires a real estate broker to immediately notify the commissioner in writing whenever a real estate salesperson enters the employ of or is terminated by that real estate broker. That law makes a willful or knowing violation of any if its provisions punishable as a misdemeanor.\\nThis bill would, beginning January 1, 2018, require that information to include whether a licensee is an associate licensee and, if the associate licensee is a broker, to identify each responsible broker with whom the licensee is contractually associated. This bill would additionally require a real estate broker to immediately notify the commissioner in writing whenever a real estate broker acting as a salesperson enters the employ of or is terminated by the responsible real estate broker and would make certain nonsubstantive changes. By placing a new requirement on a real estate broker to report to the commissioner regarding the employment or termination of a real estate broker acting as a salesperson, this bill would expand an existing crime.\\nThis bill would incorporate additional changes in Section 10083.2 of the Business and Professions Code, proposed by AB 1807, that would become operative only if AB 1807 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.\\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.', 'Existing law generally regulates the provision of bail or bond, including forfeiture, vacation of forfeiture, and exoneration of bail or bond. Existing law requires the court to declare bail to be forfeited if, without sufficient excuse, a defendant fails to appear as specified. Existing law denies the court jurisdiction to declare a forfeiture and requires the bail to be released of all obligations under the bond if the case is dismissed or if no complaint is filed within 15 days from the date of arraignment.\\nThis bill would authorize an extension of the court’s jurisdiction to declare a forfeiture and authority to release bail for not more than 90 days from the date of the arraignment if the arraignment is properly continued to allow the prosecutor time to file the complaint or if the defendant requests the extension in writing or in open court.', 'Existing law provides for the payment of unemployment compensation benefits and extended duration benefits to eligible persons who meet specified requirements. Existing law prohibits the payment of unemployment benefits to educational institution employees of a public entity, as defined, including teachers, researchers, and administrators for the period between 2 academic years when there is a reasonable assurance that the employee will perform his or her regular services in the subsequent academic year, except as specified. Existing law similarly prohibits the payment of unemployment benefits to specified educational institution employees of a public entity other than teachers, researchers, or administrators between 2 academic years, except as specified, but provides a procedure for this 2nd category of educational employees, under certain conditions, to seek payment of retroactive unemployment benefits for the period between 2 academic years. Existing law requires specified notice regarding reasonable assurance of employment in the following academic term be sent to employees before the end of the current academic term.\\nThis bill would delete the prohibition on the payment of unemployment benefits to education employees of a public school, other than teachers, researchers, and administrators, as specified, between 2 academic years. The bill would phase in up to 8 weeks of benefits available to those specified employees over a 4-year timeframe contingent on funds being appropriated for that purpose in the annual Budget Act.\\nBecause this bill would expand the categories of people who could receive benefits from the Unemployment Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, it would make an appropriation.', 'Existing law, the Ortiz-Pacheco-Poochigian-Vasconcellos Cal Grant Program, establishes the Cal Grant A and B Entitlement awards, the California Community College Transfer Cal Grant Entitlement awards, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B awards, the Cal Grant C awards, and the Cal Grant T awards under the administration of the Student Aid Commission, and establishes eligibility requirements for awards under these programs for participating students attending qualifying institutions.\\nUnder the California Community College Transfer Cal Grant Entitlement Program, a student who transfers from a California community college to a qualifying institution that offers a baccalaureate degree and who was not awarded a Cal Grant A or B Entitlement award, receives a Cal Grant A or B award if, at the time of the transfer, the student meets specified requirements, among which is a requirement that the student not be 28 years of age or older by December 31 of the award year.\\nThis bill would provide that the requirement that a student not be 28 years or older by December 31 of the award year, as described above, would not apply to a current or former member of the Armed Forces of the United States, as defined, who was seeking a Cal Grant A or B award under this provision, unless he or she is a former member who received a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge. The bill would prohibit a qualifying institution from accepting award funds under the California Community College Transfer Cal Grant Entitlement Program and Title 38 of the United States Code in the same award year for a current or former member of the Armed Forces of the United States who is 28 years of age or older.', 'The Highway Safety, Traffic Reduction, Air Quality, and Port Security Bond Act of 2006 (Proposition 1B) created the Trade Corridors Improvement Fund and provided for allocation by the California Transportation Commission of $2 billion in bond funds for infrastructure improvements on highway and rail corridors that have a high volume of freight movement, and specified categories of projects eligible to receive these funds. Existing law continues the Trade Corridors Improvement Fund in existence in order to receive revenues from sources other than the bond act for these purposes.\\nThis bill would require revenues apportioned to the state from the National Highway Freight Program established by the federal Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act to be allocated for trade corridor improvement projects approved pursuant to these provisions.\\nExisting law requires the commission, in determining projects eligible for funding, to consult various state freight and regional infrastructure and goods movement plans and the statewide port master plan.\\nThis bill would delete consideration of the State Air Resources Board’s Sustainable Freight Strategy and the statewide port master plan and would instead include consideration of the applicable port master plan and the California Sustainable Freight Action Plan of July 2016 when determining eligible projects for funding. The bill would also expand eligible projects to include rail landside access improvements, landside freight access improvements to airports, and certain capital and operational improvements. The bill would require the commission to use existing guidelines for the Trade Corridors Improvement Fund in allocating available funding but would authorize the commission to adopt amendments to the guidelines by April 1, 2017, and would impose various other requirements on the commission.', 'Existing law prohibits the taking or possession of a fully protected fish, except as provided, and designates the Owens pupfish as a fully protected fish. Under existing law, the Department of Fish and Wildlife is authorized to permit the taking of a fully protected fish for necessary scientific research, including efforts to recover fully protected, threatened, or endangered species.\\nExisting law, the California State Safe Harbor Agreement Program Act, establishes a program to encourage landowners to manage their lands voluntarily, by means of state safe harbor agreements approved by the Department of Fish and Wildlife, to benefit endangered, threatened, or candidate species without being subject to additional regulatory restrictions as a result of their conservation efforts. The act authorizes the department to authorize specified acts that are otherwise prohibited pursuant to the California Endangered Species Act by entering into a safe harbor agreement. Under existing law, the act remains in effect until January 1, 2020.\\nThis bill would authorize the department to permit the taking of the Owens pupfish in the Owens River watershed if the take is authorized under a safe harbor agreement.\\nThis bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 5515 of the Fish and Game Code, proposed by AB 1845 and AB 2488, that would become operative only if this bill and either or both of those bills are chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.', 'Existing law provides for the administration and operation of juvenile court schools by the county board of education.\\nThis bill would express the Legislature’s intent that juvenile court schools have a rigorous curriculum that includes a course of study that prepares pupils for high school graduation and career entry and fulfills the requirements for admission to the California State University and the University of California.\\nExisting law prescribes the course of study a pupil is required to complete while in grades 9 to 12, inclusive, in order to receive a diploma of graduation, and authorizes the governing board of a school district to prescribe other coursework requirements that are in addition to the statewide requirements. Existing law exempts pupils in foster care and pupils who are homeless children or youths from local graduation requirements and also requires a school district and county office of education to accept coursework satisfactorily completed by those pupils while attending another public school, a juvenile court school, or a nonpublic, nonsectarian school.\\nThis bill would make that exemption and requirement to accept coursework satisfactorily completed applicable to former juvenile court school pupils, as defined. The bill would also require a county office of education to issue a diploma of graduation to a pupil who completes statewide coursework requirements for graduation while attending a juvenile court school but does not complete coursework and other requirements that are in addition to the statewide graduation requirements. By placing additional requirements on school districts and county offices of education, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain cidden\">\\nBill Text\\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\\n\\n\\nSECTION 1.\\nSection 48645.3 of the Education Code is amended to read:\\n48645.3.\\n(a)\\xa0Juvenile court schools shall be conducted in a manner as shall be prescribed by the county board of education to best accomplish the provisions of Section 48645.
